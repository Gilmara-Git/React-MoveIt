## About

**MoveIt** is an application developed during the NLW04( Next Level Week) at Rocketseat in February 2021.
It brings a set of different exercises for Developers to move their "body" and "eyes" from time to time. Each challenge has a level of experience and every time it is completed a modal pop-ups indicating that the next level has been reached. Also, whenever there is a new challenge, a visual and audio alert is triggered to user.
